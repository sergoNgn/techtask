Coding Challenge
================

Please complete the following assignments. For GNode, please use Java. For Word
Count, you can use any language you prefer. Compilable/runnable code is
required. Code with runnable tests is preferred.

Please publish to Github or dropbox/google drive and e-mail the link.

GNode
-----
Imagine we have an interface "GNode" that looks like this:

    package cisco.java.challenge;

    public interface GNode {
        String getName();
        GNode[] getChildren();
    }

Observe that this GNode defines a graph.

Assume that when a GNode has no  children, getChildren() returns an array of
size 0, and *not* null.

Assume that all children returned by getChildren() are *not* null.

1. Implement a function with the following signature:

    `public ArrayList walkGraph(GNode);`

   which returns an ArrayList containing every GNode in the graph. Each node should
   appear in the ArrayList exactly once (i.e. no duplicates).

2. Implement a function with the following signature:

    `public ArrayList paths(GNode node);`

   which should return a ArrayList of ArrayLists, representing all possible
   paths through the graph starting at 'node'.  The ArrayList returned can be
   thought of as a ArrayList of paths, where each path is represented as an
   ArrayList of GNodes.

   Example: Assume the following graph:

        A
        ├── B
        │   ├── E
        │   └── F
        ├── C
        │   ├── G
        │   ├── H
        │   └── I
        └── D

        paths(A) = ((A B E) (A B F) (A C G) (A C H) (A C I) (A D))


Word Count
----------

Write a quick and dirty program (Shell, Python, Perl, Java, Lisp, C++, APL, or
whatever) to produce a count of all the different "words" in a text file. Use
any definition of word that makes logical sense or makes your job easy.  The
output might look like this:
6 a
    14 the
    9 of
    9 in
    8 com
    7 you
    7 that
    7 energy
    6 to
    ...

For this input file, the word "a" occured 17 times, "the" 14 times, etc.
